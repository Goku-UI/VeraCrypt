I am very new to Linux, and I want to install VeraCrypt 1.24 manually, but I'm having a hard time, and I don't know what to do. I've cloned it from github, and I've downloaded it, but after accepting the terms, I can't seem to be able to use it! I have chosen options 1 & 2, and after 2 I found it in usr, but after trying to execute the 'veracrypt' file, it says: 

bash: ./veracrypt: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

All I want is a encryption program with the ability to encrypt USBs. Please help me!
